                <h2>1. Identify Business Needs</h2>
                <p>We start by clearly identifying tasks that are good candidates for AI Agents to perform, i.e.
                    repetitive, time-consuming and boring tasks, actions performed on jobs where hiring is challenging,
                    , actions where LLMs can empower employees to focus on high-value missions.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h2>2. Technical Assessment</h2>
                <p>We analyze your technical requirements, including data sources, infrastructure setup, and integration
                    with existing systems such as internal APIs - keeping in mind how to keep the set up simple and
                    cost-effective.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <h2>3. Solution Design</h2>
                <p>Based on the assessment, we design AI solutions that perfectly match your organization's needs and
                    capabilities.</p>
                <p>We use open-source libraries that standardize the inputs and outputs of the LLMs, so that it can be
                    integrated easily with your existing systems.</p>
