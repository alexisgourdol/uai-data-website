        <h2>Why uai data?</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence is a <strong>transformative technology</strong> like electricity and the internet. We're still on the early stages of this revolution, but the rate of inonvation is staggering specially on the Large Language Models (LLMs) front.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Every organization will soon have AI Agents performing tasks that were done by humans before</strong>. Even though there are challenges and significant data engineering work for this to materialize in our world, this is likely to happen quite fast in 2025 and 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>uai data</strong>'s mission is to create Useful Artificial Intelligence solutions connected to organization's data. Our view is that:

        <ul>
            <li>business needs have to be clearly identified</li>
            <li>technical requirements have to be thoroughly understood</li>
            <li>an iterative process will start with a simple end-to-end project implement AI agents</li>

        <h2>What Are AI Agents and Their Impact on Businesses?</h2>
        <p>
            AI agents are software entities powered by artificial intelligence that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with systems or humans to achieve specific goals. They are designed to analyze data, learn from patterns, and execute actions with minimal human intervention. AI agents can adapt to changing environments and optimize their performance over time with the proper human supervision.
